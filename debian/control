Description: command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal
 drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal, a
 veritable Swiss Army knife designed to make life easier for those of us
 who spend some of our working hours hacking away at the command prompt.
 
 Drush core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code
 like modules/themes/profiles. Similarly, it runs update.php, executes
 sql queries and DB migrations, and misc utilities like run cron or clear
 cache.
